# There's a permission problem since 10.10 with the default system py2app:

# Solution:
#   - Boot in recovery mode
#   - csrutil disable
#   - Reboot
#   - sudo chflags -R norestricted /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework
#   - Reboot into recovery mode
#   - csrutil enable
#   - Reboot and build...
# You need to do that before this will work!

# Py2app does not copy permissions (executable) when bundling resources.
# This may actually not be the right place for the executable, but it works
# for the moment, as long as we tweak the permissions when it's completed.
